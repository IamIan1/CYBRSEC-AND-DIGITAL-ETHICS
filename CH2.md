### Evolution from Brick and Mortar to E-Commerce

- E-commerce
  - Sale of goods and services on the Internet
- Business-to-consumer (B2C)
  - Customers purchase goods and services directly from their website
- Business-to-business (B2B)
  - Businesses conduct sales with other businesses
- Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
  - Protects private customer data
- Internet business challenges:
  - Growing the business through the Internet
  - Changing an existing conventional business into an e-business
  - Building secure and highly available websites and e-commerce portals
  - Building a web-enabled customer-service strategy
  - Finding new customers with Internet marketing

### E-Business Strategy Elements

- E-commerce solution
- Internet marketing strategy
- E-customer service-delivery strategy
- Payment and credit card transaction processing

### Why Businesses Must Have an Internet and IoT Marketing Strategy

- Must remain competitive
- Brick-and-mortar business model out of date in the global market
- Customers require continuous access to information, products, and services

### Transforming to an E-Business Model on the Web

### IP Mobility

- Personal communication devices and mobile phones are powerful
- Cell phones are used to extend mobility
- Smartphones, tablets, and wearable smart devices match the power and flexibility of small computers
- Tablets and smartphones fill the need for lightweight portable devices

### Mobile Users and Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)

- Employees and contractors use personal devices to connect to the office network
- Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) opens the door to considerable security issues
- Mobile device users expect mobility and freedom from desktop computers
- Issues with mobile computing:
  - Network speed
  - Usability
  - Security

### Mobile Applications

- Limited web browsers cannot run some traditional applications
- Bad interface design causes application failure on mobile devices
- Many users from multiple domains found uses for mobile applications
- Medical applications were a good fit for mobile applications

### IP Mobile Communications

- 4G and 5G networks provide true IP communications
- Mobile IP enables users to:
  - Move between local area network (LAN) segments and stay connected without interruption
  - Maintain a connection to the network as long as the mobile device stays within network coverage
- Mobile node (MN)
  - Connects to FA
- Home agent (HA)
  - Assigns COA to MN
- Foreign agent (FA)
  - Sends COA to HA
- Care of address (COA)
  - Local address for the MN
- Correspondent node (CN)
  - Sends message to MN

### New Challenges Created by the IoT

- Security
- Privacy
- Interoperability and standards
- Legal and regulatory compliance
- E-commerce and economic development issues

### Security 

- IoT devices, such as sensors or consumer items, deployed in large quantities
- IoT devices are ubiquitous and can have a wide reach into the user or household population
- IoT devices not maintained or updated allow vulnerabilities
- IoT device upgrades can be difficult to distribute and deploy
- No owner visibility of how many IoT devices connect to the Internet
- IoT devices usually not physically secure
- Environmental IoT devices capture readings and measurements in the open

### Privacy

- Privacy challenges must be addressed by manufacturers and defined in the right-of-use and software End-User Licensing Agreement (EULA):
  - Privacy policy statement
  - Definition of data, metadata, or analytical data use and rights
  - Ability for a user to provide consent to a manufacturer’s or application service provider’s privacy policy statement
  - Determine the domain of privacy

### Interoperability and Standards
- Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) ensures interoperability and standards can be pursued for IoT solutions
- Interoperability has significant financial impacts if not properly addressed
- Goal is to bring down the cost of IoT devices and supporting applications so they are affordable
- Some manufacturers want to design and deploy proprietary IoT devices and solutions
- Cost factors to implement functional, operational, technical, and security capabilities into IoT devices and applications
- Time-to-market risk
- Technology outdated risk
- A void in interoperability and standards for IoT devices can create an environment of bad IoT devices

### Legal and Regulatory Compliance

- Properly handling and protecting sensitive data, and ensuring its confidentiality
- Privacy data is subject to the privacy laws of the state you live in as well as the state that the IoT hosting company resides in
- IoT vendor or solutions provider required to adhere to security control requirements and data protection laws
- Current liability laws and protection may or may not address IoT devices connected to the public Internet
- Who is collecting data?
- Who is collecting behavior patterns?
- Are they selling this data?
- Do they

 have the right to sell it?
- Is there liability associated with the data?

### E-Commerce and Economic Development Issues

- Infrastructure resources
- Foundational investments
- Technical and industrial development
- Policy and regulatory definitions
