# Chapter 4 Study Guide: Business Drivers of Information Security

### Learning Objective(s) and Key Concepts

**Learning Objective(s):**
- Explain information systems security and its effect on people and businesses.

**Key Concepts:**
- Risk management and approaches
- Overview of contingency planning: business impact analysis (BIA), business continuity plan (BCP), and disaster recovery plan (DRP)
- Assessing risks, threats, and vulnerabilities
- Adhering to compliance laws and governance
- Mobile workers and use of personally owned devices

### Risk Management’s Importance to the Organization (1 of 2)
- Identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and addressing risks is a core business driver necessary to ensure any organization’s longevity
- Risk management activities should align with the organization’s strategic goals
- Risks can be positive or negative
- Minimize the effects of negative risks
- Maximize the effects of positive risks
- A common pitfall in building a risk management plan is to limit the scope of the risk identification process to just inside the organization
- Consider reliance on third-party entities to conduct business, such as vendors and the supply chain

### Risks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities

### Risk Management’s Importance to the Organization (2 of 2)
- Process of identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and addressing risks
- Ensures you have planned for risks that may affect your organization
- Risk methodology
- A description of how you will manage risk
- Risk register
- A list of identified risks

### Understanding the Relationship Between a BIA, a BCP, and a DRP
- Protecting an organization’s IT resources and ensuring that events do not interrupt normal business functions
- Business impact analysis (BIA)
- Business continuity plan (BCP)
- Disaster recovery plan (DRP)

### BIA
- An analysis of an organization’s functions and activities that classifies them as critical or noncritical
- Identifies the impact on the business if one or more IT functions fail
- Identifies the priority of different critical systems

### BIA Recovery Goals and Requirements
- Recovery point objective (RPO)
- The target state of recovered data that allows an organization to continue normal processing; the maximum amount of data loss that is acceptable
- Recovery time objective (RTO)
- The maximum allowable time in which to recover the function
- Business recovery requirements
- Identify any other business functions that must already be in place for the specified recovery function to occur and help in determining the recovery sequence
- Technical recovery requirements
- Define the technical prerequisites that are needed to support each critical business function

### BCP (1 of 2)
- A written plan for a structured response to any events that result in an interruption to critical business activities or functions
- Order of priorities:
  1. Safety and well-being of people
  2. Continuity of critical business functions and operations
  3. Continuity of components within the seven domains of an IT infrastructure

### BCP (2 of 2)
- Elements of a complete BCP:
  - Statement defining the policy, standards, procedures, and guidelines for deployment
  - Project team members with defined roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities
  - Emergency response procedures and protection of life, safety, and infrastructure
  - Situation and damage assessment
  - Resource salvage and recovery
  - Alternate facilities or triage for short- or long-term emergency mode of operations and business recovery

### DRP (1 of 2)
- Directs the actions necessary to recover resources after a disaster
- Extends and supports the BCP by identifying events that could cause damage to resources that are necessary to support critical business functions
- Consider what could happen to each resource:
  - Threat analysis
  - Impact scenarios
  - Recovery requirement documentation
  - Disaster recovery

### DRP (2 of 2)
- Hot site
  - Has environmental utilities, hardware, software, and data like the original data center
- Warm site
  - Has environmental utilities and basic computer hardware
- Cold site
  - Has basic environmental utilities but no infrastructure components
- Mobile site
  - Trailer with necessary environmental utilities that can operate as a warm or cold site

### DRP Tests
- Checklist test
- Structured walk-through
- Simulation test
- Parallel test
- Full-interruption test

### Assessing Risks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities
- Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems (NIST SP800-30)
- Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation (OCTAVE)
- ISO/IEC 27005:2018 “Information Security Risk Management”

### Closing the Information Security Gap
- Security gap: Difference between the security controls in place and controls you need to address vulnerabilities
- Gap analysis: Comparison of the security controls in place and the controls you need to address all identified threats

### Steps for Conducting a Gap Analysis (1 of 2)
- Identify the applicable elements of the security policy and other standards
- Assemble policy, standard, procedure, and guideline documents
- Review and assess the implementation of the policies, standards, procedures, and guidelines
- Collect inventory information for all hardware and software components

### Steps for Conducting a Gap Analysis (2 of 2)
- Interview users to assess knowledge of and compliance with policies
- Compare the current security environment to policies in place
- Prioritize identified gaps for resolution
- Document and implement the remedies to conform to policies

### Adhering to Compliance Laws (1 of 2)
- Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)
- Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC)
- Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA)
- Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)
- Government Information Security Reform Act (Security Reform Act) of 2000
- The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001
- Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)

### Adhering to Compliance Laws (2 of 2)
- Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)
- California Security Breach Information Act (SB 1386) of 2003
- Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
- Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA)
- European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of 2016
- Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) of 2018

### Security Compliance Laws and Standards Timeline
