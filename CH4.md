# Chapter 4 Study Guide: Business Drivers of Information Security

## Business Drivers of Information Security

### Learning Objective(s) and Key Concepts

**Learning Objective(s):**
- Explain information systems security and its effect on people and businesses.

**Key Concepts:**
- Risk management and approaches
- Overview of contingency planning: business impact analysis (BIA), business continuity plan (BCP), and disaster recovery plan (DRP)
- Assessing risks, threats, and vulnerabilities
- Adhering to compliance laws and governance
- Mobile workers and the use of personally owned devices

### Risk Management’s Importance to the Organization

- Identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and addressing risks as a core business driver necessary to ensure any organization’s longevity
- Risk management activities should align with the organization’s strategic goals
- Risks can be positive or negative
- Minimize the effects of negative risks
- Maximize the effects of positive risks
- Common pitfall in building a risk management plan is to limit the scope of the risk identification process to just inside the organization
- Consider reliance on third-party entities to conduct business, such as vendors and supply chain

### Risks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities

- Process of identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and addressing risks
- Ensures you have planned for risks that may affect your organization
- Risk methodology and risk register

### Understanding the Relationship Between a BIA, a BCP, and a DRP

- Protecting an organization’s IT resources and ensuring that events do not interrupt normal business functions
- Business impact analysis (BIA), business continuity plan (BCP), and disaster recovery plan (DRP)

### BIA

- An analysis of an organization’s functions and activities that classifies them as critical or noncritical
- Identifies the impact on the business if one or more IT functions fails
- Identifies the priority of different critical systems

### BIA Recovery Goals and Requirements

- Recovery point objective (RPO) and recovery time objective (RTO)
- Business recovery requirements and technical recovery requirements

### BCP

- A written plan for a structured response to any events that result in an interruption to critical business activities or functions
- Priorities: safety and well-being of people, continuity of critical business functions and operations, and continuity of components within the seven domains of an IT infrastructure

### DRP

- Directs the actions necessary to recover resources after a disaster
- Extends and supports the BCP by identifying events that could cause damage to resources that are necessary to support critical business functions
- Consider what could happen to each resource: threat analysis, impact scenarios, recovery requirement documentation, and disaster recovery

### DRP (continued)

- Types of recovery sites: hot site, warm site, cold site, and mobile site
- DRP tests: checklist test, structured walk-through, simulation test, parallel test, and full-interruption test

### Assessing Risks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities

- Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems (NIST SP800-30)
- Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation (OCTAVE)
- ISO/IEC 27005:2018 “Information Security Risk Management”

### Closing the Information Security Gap

- Security gap and gap analysis
- Steps for conducting a gap analysis: identify applicable elements, assemble documents, review and assess, collect inventory information, interview users, compare current security environment, prioritize identified gaps, document and implement remedies

### Adhering to Compliance Laws

- Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), Government Information Security Reform Act (Security Reform Act) of 2000, The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), California Security Breach Information Act (SB 1386) of 2003, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA), European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of 2016, Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) of 2018

### Security Compliance Laws and Standards Timeline

### Keeping Private Data Confidential

- Ensuring availability and integrity is important
- Cannot undo a confidentiality violation
- Authentication controls, authorization controls, and other measures for keeping data confidential

### Mobile Workers and Use of Personally Owned Devices

- Mobility allows remote workers and employees to be connected to the IT infrastructure in almost real time
- Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) concerns: data ownership, support ownership, patch management, antivirus management, forensics, privacy, acceptable use policy, onboard camera/video, onboarding/offboarding, adherence to corporate policies, user acceptance, architecture/infrastructure considerations, legal concerns
- Endpoint and device security measures

### Summary

- Risk management and approaches
- Overview of contingency planning: business impact analysis (BIA), business continuity plan (BCP), and disaster recovery plan (DRP)
- Assessing risks, threats, and vulnerabilities
- Adhering to compliance laws and governance
- Mobile workers and the use of personally owned devices
