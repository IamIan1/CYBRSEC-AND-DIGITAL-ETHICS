## Risk Management and Information Security (1 of 2)

- Seek a balance between the utility and cost of various risk management options.
- Identify risks and apply risk management solutions to ensure that critical business functions can continue to operate.
- Key risk management principles:
  - Do not spend more to protect an asset than it is worth.
  - Every countermeasure requires resources to implement and therefore should be aligned with a specific risk.
- Conduct a business impact analysis (BIA).
- Create or maintain a business continuity plan (BCP).
- Develop or maintain a disaster recovery plan (DRP).

## Risk Terminology

- Risk: Likelihood that something bad will happen to an asset.
- Threat: Something bad that might happen to an organization.
- Vulnerability: Any exposure that could allow a threat to be realized.
- Impact: The amount of risk or harm caused by a threat or vulnerability that is exploited by a perpetrator.
- Event: A measurable occurrence that has an impact on the business.
- Incident: Any event that violates or threatens to violate your security policy.
- Control: Includes both safeguards and countermeasures.
- Safeguard: Addresses gaps or weaknesses in controls that could lead to a realized threat.
- Countermeasure: Counters or addresses a specific threat.

## Elements of Risk

- Component parts of risk: Assets, Vulnerabilities, Threats.
- Perform risk assessments to identify new or changed risks over time.
- More than a quarter of all reported attacks are by insiders.
- The impact of insider attacks is proportionately worse than attacks by outsiders.

## Purpose of Risk Management

- Identify risks before they lead to an incident.
- Identify the tolerable risk level and apply controls to reduce risks to that level.
- Contingency planning focuses on planning to anticipate and respond to risk without interrupting the most critical business functionality.

## The Risk Management Process

- **Identify Risks:**
  - Brainstorming
  - Surveys
  - Interviews
  - Working groups
  - Checklists
  - Historical information

## Sample Risk Register

- **Risk Register Components:**
  - A description of the risk
  - The expected impact if the associated event occurs
  - The probability of the event’s occurring
  - Steps to mitigate the risk
  - Steps to take should the event occur
  - Rank of the risk

## Assess and Prioritize Risks

- **Quantitative risk assessment:**
  - Examines the cost or value of the identified risk and its financial impact.
  - Describes risk in financial terms and puts a dollar value on each risk.
- **Qualitative risk assessment:**
  - Examines the risk impact by assigning a rating for each identified risk.
  - Ranks risks based on their probability of occurrence and impact on business operations.

## Quantitative Versus Qualitative Risk Assessments

- **Quantitative Risk Assessment:**
  - Calculate asset value (AV)
  - Calculate exposure factor (EF)
  - Calculate single loss expectancy (SLE)
  - Determine how often a loss is likely to occur every year
  - Determine annualized loss expectancy (ALE)

## Determining Quantified Risk

- **Calculation Formula:**
  - Single loss expectancy (SLE) = AV × EF
  - Annualized rate of occurrence (ARO) = Number of incidents per year
  - Annualized loss expectancy (ALE) = SLE × ARO
- Example:
  - 100 users in an organization use laptop computers.
  - Each computer with software and data = $1,500.
  - Organization loses an average of six computers per year.
  - SLE is $1,500.
  - ARO is 6.
  - ALE is $9,000 ($1,500 × 6).
  - Suggested countermeasure is to purchase hardware locks at a cost of $10 each to reduce yearly losses from six to one.
  - Cost of countermeasure is $1,000 ($10 × 100 computers).
  - New ARO is 1.
  - New ALE is $1,500 ($1,500 × 1).

## Qualitative Risk Analysis

- Judge risk on two scales:
  - Probability or likelihood
  - Impact

## Plan a Risk Response Strategy

- **Negative risks:**
  - Reduce (reduction/mitigation)
  - Transfer (transference/assignment)
  - Accept (acceptance)
  - Avoid (avoidance)
- **Positive risks:**
  - Exploit (exploitation)
  - Share (sharing)
  - Enhance (enhancement)
  - Accept (acceptance)

## Acceptable Range of Risk

## Total Risk and Residual Risk

## Implement the Risk Response Plan

- Administrative controls: Manage the activity phase of security—the things people do.
- Activity phase controls: Either administrative or technical, corresponding to the life cycle of a security program.
- Detective controls, Preventive controls, Corrective controls, Deterrent controls, Compensating controls.

- Disconnect unreliable networks.

## Pricing/Costing a Countermeasure

- **Cost Factors:**
  - Product costs
  - Implementation costs
  - Compatibility costs

## Service Availability and Productivity

- Critical services must be available for use when organizations need them.
- Downtime: The time during which a service is not available due to failure or maintenance.
