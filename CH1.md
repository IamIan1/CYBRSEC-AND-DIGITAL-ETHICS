**Information Systems Security Overview:**
- **Internet:**
  - A global network with approximately 5 billion users.
  - Links governments, businesses, and organizations.
  - World Wide Web: Defines document and resource relationships across a computer network.

- **Security Incidents:**
  - Examples include the 2019 data breach at First American Financial Corporation and the 2020 theft of FireEye's penetration testing tools.

- **Cyberspace: The New Frontier:**
  - Introduction to the evolving landscape of cyberspace and the Internet of Things (IoT).

- **Risks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities:**
  - Definitions of risk, threat, and vulnerability in the context of information security.

- **What Is Information Systems Security?**
  - Explanation of information systems, security, and the collective activities protecting data and systems.

**Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:**
- **Tenets of Information Security:**
  - Overview of the fundamental principles: confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

- **Confidentiality:**
  - Definition and importance.
  - Discussion of cryptographic methods, including encryption and ciphertext.

- **Integrity:**
  - Ensuring valid and accurate information.

- **Availability:**
  - Defining the amount of time users can access systems, applications, and data.
  - Various time measurements and objectives for availability.

**Seven Domains of a Typical IT Infrastructure:**
- **User Domain:**
  - Roles, tasks, responsibilities, and accountability.
  - Common threats and potential risks.

- **Workstation Domain:**
  - Roles, responsibilities, and accountability.
  - Identifying threats and vulnerabilities.

- **LAN, LAN-to-WAN, and WAN Domains:**
  - Roles, responsibilities, and accountability for each domain.
  - Common threats and vulnerabilities.

- **Remote Access Domain:**
  - Roles, responsibilities, and accountability.
  - Addressing threats related to remote access.

- **System/Application Domain:**
  - Roles, responsibilities, and accountability.
  - Recognizing common threats and vulnerabilities.

- **Weakest Link in IT Infrastructure Security:**
  - Humans identified as the weakest link.
  - Strategies for reducing risk.

- **Ethics and the Internet:**
  - Emphasizing the importance of ethical behavior online and the growing demand for security professionals.

- **IT Security Policy Framework:**
  - Definitions of policy, standard, procedure, and guideline.
  - Overview of the hierarchical IT security policy framework.

- **Foundational IT Security Policies:**
  - Brief explanations of essential policies including AUP, security awareness, asset classification, and more.

- **Data Classification Standards:**
  - Understanding different data classifications (private, confidential, internal use, public domain).
  - U.S. federal government data classification standards (top secret, secret, confidential).

**Summary:**
- Recapitulation of key concepts, including information systems security principles, C-I-A, seven IT infrastructure domains, the weakest link in security, and IT security policy framework along with data classification standards.
