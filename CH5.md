# Chapter 5 Study Guide: Networks and Telecommunications

## Networks and Telecommunications

### Learning Objective(s) and Key Concepts

**Learning Objective(s):**
- Describe networking principles and security mechanisms.

**Key Concepts:**
- The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model
- Types of networks and their devices
- Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and how it works
- Network security risks and defense tools
- Wireless networks and security controls

### The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model

- Overview of the OSI Reference Model
- Seven layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application
- Function of each layer

### Types of Networks

#### Wide Area Networks (WANs)

- Connect systems over a large geographic area
- Security challenges in an open network
- Encryption for data security
- Private WANs and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)
- WAN connectivity options: cable modem, DSL, fiber optics, satellite, dialup, cellular networks

#### Local Area Networks (LANs)

- Provide network connectivity for computers in the same geographic area
- LAN devices: hubs, switches
- Ethernet networks and the Ethernet standard

#### Virtual LANs (VLANs)

- Logical segmentation of network devices
- Isolating logical groups for reduced network traffic and increased security

### Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)

- Protocol suite operating at the Network and Transport layers
- Development by the Department of Defense
- IP addressing (IPv4 and IPv6)
- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
- Common ports and protocols: FTP, SSH, SMTP, DNS, HTTP, HTTPS, ICMP

### Network Security Risks

- Reconnaissance, eavesdropping, DoS, DDoS, TDoS
- Basic defense tools: Firewalls, VPNs, Network Access Control (NAC)

### Firewalls

- Control traffic flow, prevent unauthorized traffic
- Types: Packet filtering, stateful inspection, application proxy
- Deployment techniques: Border firewalls, screened subnet firewalls, multilayered firewalls, unified threat management

### VPNs and Remote Access

- Major VPN technologies: PPTP, SSL/TLS, SSTP, IPSec, OpenVPN

### Network Access Control (NAC)

- Authentication and posture checking
- IEEE 802.1x standard

### Voice and Video in an IP Network

- Securing SIP and VoIP
- Encryption, VLANs, VPN use, strong authentication, firewalls

### Wireless Networks

- Wireless access points (WAPs)
- Wireless network security controls: VPN, encryption (WEP, CCMP, WPA, WPA2, WPA3), SSID broadcast, MAC address filtering
- Additional security techniques: Antennas, power-level controls, captive portals, site surveys

### Summary

- Overview of the OSI Reference Model
- Types of networks and their devices
- TCP/IP and how it works
- Network security risks and defense tools
- Wireless networks and security controls
