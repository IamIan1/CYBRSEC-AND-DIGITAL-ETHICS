## Networks and Telecommunications

### Learning Objective(s) and Key Concepts

**Learning Objective(s):**
- Describe networking principles and security mechanisms.

**Key Concepts:**
- The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model
- Types of networks and their devices
- Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and how it works
- Network security risks and defense tools
- Wireless networks and security controls

### The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model

- **Overview of the OSI Reference Model:**
  - Hierarchical structure with seven layers.
  - Layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application.
  - Each layer has specific functions contributing to data communication.

### Types of Networks

#### Wide Area Networks (WANs)

- **Connect systems over a large geographic area:**
  - Involves connecting devices across significant distances.
  - Requires special considerations for data security.

- **Security challenges in an open network:**
  - The Internet, as an open network, poses data security challenges.
  - Encryption is crucial for securing data in transit.

- **Encryption for data security:**
  - Utilizing encryption methods to secure data during transmission.

- **Private WANs and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs):**
  - Establishing private networks for enhanced security.
  - Implementing Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) for secure data exchange.

- **WAN connectivity options:**
  - Cable modem, DSL, fiber optics, satellite, dialup, cellular networks.

#### Local Area Networks (LANs)

- **Provide network connectivity for computers in the same geographic area:**
  - Linking computers within a limited geographic area.
  - Use of devices like hubs and switches for connectivity.

- **LAN devices:**
  - Hubs: Basic connectors for multiple devices.
  - Switches: Intelligent devices for efficient data routing.

- **Ethernet networks and the Ethernet standard:**
  - Common LAN technology.
  - Governs communication using Media Access Control (MAC) addresses.

#### Virtual LANs (VLANs)

- **Logical segmentation of network devices:**
  - Creating logical partitions in the network.
  - Enhances security and reduces network traffic.

### Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)

- **Protocol suite operating at the Network and Transport layers:**
  - Fundamental for Internet and corporate network activities.
  - Developed by the Department of Defense.

- **IP addressing (IPv4 and IPv6):**
  - IPv4: 32-bit addresses, still prevalent.
  - IPv6: 128-bit addresses, providing more unique device addresses.

- **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP):**
  - Dynamically assigns network configuration to devices.

- **Common ports and protocols:**
  - FTP, SSH, SMTP, DNS, HTTP, HTTPS, ICMP.

### Network Security Risks

- **Reconnaissance, eavesdropping, DoS, DDoS, TDoS:**
  - Gathering information, tapping data cables, flooding with traffic.
  - Utilizing multiple compromised systems for attacks.

- **Basic defense tools:**
  - Firewalls, VPNs, Network Access Control (NAC).

### Firewalls

- **Control traffic flow, prevent unauthorized traffic:**
  - Critical for network security.

- **Types:**
  - Packet filtering, stateful inspection, application proxy.

- **Deployment techniques:**
  - Border firewalls, screened subnet firewalls, multilayered firewalls, unified threat management.

### VPNs and Remote Access

- **Major VPN technologies:**
  - PPTP, SSL/TLS, SSTP, IPSec, OpenVPN.

### Network Access Control (NAC)

- **Authentication and posture checking:**
  - Adds security requirements before network entry.
  - Governed by the IEEE 802.1x standard.

### Voice and Video in an IP Network

- **Securing SIP and VoIP:**
  - Ensuring security in voice and video communication.
  - Use of encryption, VLANs, VPNs, strong authentication, firewalls.

### Wireless Networks

- **Wireless access points (WAPs):**
  - Facilitate wireless communication between devices and the network.

- **Wireless network security controls:**
  - VPNs, encryption (WEP, CCMP, WPA, WPA2, WPA3), SSID broadcast, MAC address filtering.

- **Additional security techniques:**
  - Antennas, power-level controls, captive portals, site surveys.

### Summary

- **Overview of the OSI Reference Model.**
- **Types of networks and their devices.**
- **TCP/IP and its functioning.**
- **Network security risks and defense tools.**
- **Wireless networks and security controls.**
